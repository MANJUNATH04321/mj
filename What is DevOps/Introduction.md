# What is DevOps

According to Google:

The organizational and cultural movement that aims to increase software delivery velocity, improve service reliability, and build 
shared ownership among software stakeholders.

According to RedHat:

DevOps describes approaches to speeding up the processes by which an idea (like a new software feature, a request for 
enhancement, or a bug fix) goes from development to deployment in a production environment where it can provide value to the user. 

These approaches require that development teams and operations teams communicate frequently and approach their work
with empathy for their teammates. Scalability and flexible provisioning are also necessary. 

With DevOps, those that need power the most, get it—through self service and automation. 

Developers, usually coding in a standard development environment, work closely with IT operations to 
speed software builds, tests, and releases—without sacrificing reliability.

- Continuous Delivery.
- Enhanced Security.
- Path to build large scale systems.
